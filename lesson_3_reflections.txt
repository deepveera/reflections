When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to share the code with wider audience and users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Avoid publishing code that is not ready to pubic.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - clone @ Github with actual reference to the source and it owner.
    Clone - copy of repository with all te .git meta data
    branch - it is a commit state with links to all previous cain of commits and furter it will proceed as separate node 

    Fork - when need to modify a repositury, but not alllowed to update the original.
    Clone - To work on a already existing repository
    Branc - Taking all te previous commits and working separately hence forth till merged

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
