How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    command line  - easy to compare than manual

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    find te change istory, and bugs, typos, mistakes easily.  Lesser time in debugging.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  Pros: commit when needed, logical number of commited version, related changes
  Cons: need manual, may forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A related logical change can be spread across multiple files.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --> to view the history of changes, change owner and short description
    git diff --> to compare changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    ensure previous version, enables comparison and find faulty code
